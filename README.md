# 📷 My Personal Image Hosting on GitHub

This is a personal project that I created to host my images on GitHub. As an avid blogger and content creator, I needed a reliable and easily accessible image hosting platform. GitHub provided the perfect solution for me, as it offers unlimited storage and bandwidth for free.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use this image hosting service, you can simply upload your images to the `images` directory in this repository. You can then access your images using the following URL format: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repository>/main/images/<image-name>.<extension>`. Replace `<username>` and `<repository>` with your GitHub username and the name of this repository, respectively. Replace `<image-name>` with the name of the image file you uploaded, and `<extension>` with the file extension (e.g. png, jpg, gif).

## 📝 Usage

You can use this image hosting service for a variety of purposes, such as:

- Embedding images in your blog posts or articles
- Sharing images with friends or colleagues
- Storing images for personal or professional use
